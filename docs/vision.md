= Production Vision

I want to create a web application that allows users to manage track and field competitions.
Athletes are grouped into categories and categories define which events the athletes compete in.
The points are calculated based on the results of the events according to the IAAF ranking formulas.
After every athlete has finished the competition, the points are calculated and the athlete is ranked.
The ranking list must be grouped by category and each line shows the athlete the results and the points.
