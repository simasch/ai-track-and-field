# Use Case Specification: UC-001 - Create Competition

## 1. Use Case Identification

**Use Case ID:** UC-001  
**Use Case Name:** Create Competition  
**Related Requirement:** FR-001  
**Priority:** High  
**Actor:** Administrator  
**System:** Track and Field Competition Management System

## 2. Brief Description

This use case describes the process by which an administrator creates a new track and field competition in the system. The administrator provides essential competition details, and the system stores this information for future management of athletes, categories, and results.

## 3. Preconditions

- The administrator is authenticated and logged into the system
- The administrator has the necessary permissions to create competitions
- The system database is accessible and operational

## 4. Basic Flow

1. The administrator navigates to the Competition Management section
2. The administrator selects the "Create New Competition" option
3. The system displays the competition creation form
4. The administrator enters the following competition details:
   - Competition name (required)
   - Competition date (required)
   - Location/venue (required)
5. The administrator submits the form
6. The system validates the entered data:
   - Ensures all required fields are filled
   - Validates date format and ensures it's a valid date
   - Checks that the competition name is not empty
7. The system generates a unique UUID for the competition
8. The system saves the competition to the database with:
   - Generated UUID as primary key
   - Provided competition details
   - Current timestamp for created_at and updated_at fields
9. The system automatically triggers UC-004 (Define Categories) to set up competition categories
10. The system displays a success confirmation message
11. The system redirects to the competition details view

## 5. Alternative Flows

### 5.1 Duplicate Competition Name (Warning)
**At step 6:**
- If a competition with the same name and date already exists:
  1. The system displays a warning message
  2. The system asks for confirmation to proceed
  3. If confirmed, continue with step 7
  4. If cancelled, return to step 4

### 5.2 Past Date Selection
**At step 4:**
- If the administrator selects a date in the past:
  1. The system displays a warning message
  2. The system allows the administrator to proceed (for historical data entry)
  3. Continue with step 5

### 5.3 Invalid Data Entry
**At step 6:**
- If validation fails:
  1. The system highlights the fields with errors
  2. The system displays specific error messages for each invalid field
  3. The administrator corrects the errors
  4. Return to step 5

## 6. Exception Flows

### 6.1 Database Connection Failure
**At step 8:**
- If the database is unavailable:
  1. The system displays an error message
  2. The system logs the error with details
  3. The system advises the administrator to try again later
  4. The use case ends unsuccessfully

### 6.2 Session Timeout
**At any step:**
- If the administrator's session expires:
  1. The system saves the entered data temporarily
  2. The system redirects to the login page
  3. After successful re-authentication, the system restores the form data
  4. Continue from the step where the timeout occurred

## 7. Postconditions

### Success Postconditions
- A new competition record is created in the database
- The competition has a unique UUID identifier
- The competition is available for category definition (UC-004)
- The competition appears in the list of active competitions
- Audit timestamps (created_at, updated_at) are set

### Failure Postconditions
- No competition record is created
- The system state remains unchanged
- Error is logged for system administrators

## 8. Includes

- UC-004: Define Categories (automatically triggered after successful competition creation)

## 9. Business Rules

- BR-001: Competition names should be descriptive and include the year
- BR-002: Competition dates can be in the future or past (for historical data)
- BR-003: Location must be a valid venue or city name
- BR-004: Each competition must have at least one category defined before athletes can register

## 10. Special Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Competition creation should complete within 2 seconds
- Form validation should provide immediate feedback (< 500ms)

### Security Requirements
- Only authenticated administrators can create competitions
- All database operations must use parameterized queries
- Competition creation events must be logged in the audit trail

### Usability Requirements
- Form should provide clear labels and help text
- Date picker should be provided for date selection
- Location field should support autocomplete from previous entries

## 11. Assumptions

- Administrators have basic knowledge of track and field competitions
- The system has sufficient storage for competition data
- Network connectivity is stable during the creation process

## 12. Frequency of Use

- High during competition season (March-September)
- Approximately 5-10 new competitions per month
- Peak usage during planning periods (January-February)

## 13. User Interface Mockup Description

The competition creation form should include:
- Header: "Create New Competition"
- Form fields:
  - Competition Name (text input, max 255 characters)
  - Date (date picker)
  - Location (text input with autocomplete, max 255 characters)
- Action buttons:
  - "Create Competition" (primary action)
  - "Cancel" (secondary action)
- After creation, option to immediately "Define Categories" should be prominent

## 14. Open Issues

- Should the system support competition templates for recurring annual events?
- Should there be a limit on the number of active competitions?
- Should competition creation notify relevant stakeholders via email?
