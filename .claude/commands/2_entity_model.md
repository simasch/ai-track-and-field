Create an entity model (docs/entity_model.md) based on docs/requirements.md as a Markdown file.
Add a description of the entity with the attributes/columns with the data type and validation rules. The entity must
use a sequence for the primary keys.
Include a Mermaid.js ERD diagram that shows the entity names (no columns) and the relationships between the entities.
